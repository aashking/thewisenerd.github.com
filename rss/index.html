<p>(<em>in case you are wondering if facebook does really have a "delete account" option, yes. It does. go <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>So, follow the following steps, enjoy!</p>

<ul>  
<li>Go to Facebook, change your password.</li>  
<li>Make sure it is from a random website generator (<a href="http://bit.ly/HksvBX">here</a>).</li>  
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account">https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account</a> and delete your account.</li>  
<li>make sure you select "log out of other devices"</li>  
<li>wait for 14 days, and voilà! you have successfully deleted your account.</li>  
</ul>

<p>Also, to make sure you don't/can't get back in, forever, even if you made a backup of your randomly generated password, change your email to some temporary email provider (<a href="http://bit.ly/tPAYVx">here</a>). That way, even if you can't fight the urge to not go back in, you have a <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/goof-proof">goof-proof</a> plan 😜</p>

So, if you know about them, you can stop reading this post, and pump up the performance of your PC (a little) and change them governors yourself the next time you are doing some heavy processing like compiling something big (AOSP reference here), or  </p>

<pre><code>avconv -i awesomemovie.mp4 -c:a copy -c:v copy outfile.avi  
</code></pre>

<p>you get the drift.</p>

<p>Governors for CPUs in a nutshell:  </p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>CPU frequency scaling enables the operating system to scale the CPU frequency up or down in order to save power. CPU frequencies can be scaled automatically depending on the system load, in response to ACPI events, or manually by userspace programs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>>documentation "taken" from archlinux <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/CPU_frequency_scaling">wiki</a> (they have awesome docs)</em></p>

<p>So, they either pump up the power consumed by your CPU, which increases performance (a bit), unless of course you are running a PIII or a PIV (or a contemporary) which is pathetically slow (relatively) and nothing can be done about it; or they pump down the power consumed, read: lesser performance.</p>

<p>The CPU freqs are basically the power you guzzle. If you are running 3.3 GHz, you are more likely to use more power than if you are running 1.6 GHz on the same processor; but hey! that can be <em>sacrificed</em> to save compile times or video conversion times! There are two cpufreqs (freq: frequency): scaling_min_freq, scaling_max_freq. Pretty self explainatory: min_freq is the minimum frequency your CPU is allowed to go down to, and CPU max freq the maximum frequency your CPU is allowed to go up. <br>  
For a list of available frequencies on your PC, sudo, and this:  </p>

<pre><code>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies  
</code></pre>

<p>why cpu0? because it is the most generic, omnipresent, yada yada, at least one core needed, yada yada, <em>really hoping you get the drift here</em>.</p>

<p>Lets quickly jump over to governors. <br>  
<em>again from the archlinux wiki; focussing on two imporant governors</em></p>

<table border="2px">  
<tr>  
<td>  
ondemand  
</td>  
<td>  
Dynamically switch between CPU(s) available if at 95% cpu load  
</td>  
</tr>  
<tr>  
<td>  
performance  
</td>  
<td>  
Run the cpu at max frequency  
</td>  
</tr></table>

<p>So, given what they do, I'll list out their uses: I use <strong>ondemand</strong> for day-to-day usage, and <strong>performance</strong> for compile times, heavy processing, etc, etc; and I suggest you do the same (unless of course, you want to be stuck up with ~3 hour compile times, and a only PC in the house).</p>

<h4 id="howtoswitch">How to switch?</h4>

<p>No big deal! Just this:  </p>

<pre><code>echo &lt;governor-name&gt; | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor &gt;/dev/null  
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;governor-name&gt; can be got from/through/by this command:</p>

<pre><code>cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors  
</code></pre>

<p>I also like to set the scaling<em>min</em>freq to a high value (not so high enough that it fries my PC), so that it can be a goofproof in case something goes wrong. How to do that? Simple again. <br>  
here, i'm setting the min scaling frequency of my CPU to 3.0 GHz:  </p>

<pre><code>echo "3000000"   | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq &gt;/dev/null  
</code></pre>

<p>"&gt;/dev/null" redirects stdout to /dev/null supressing any... stdout(?).</p>

<p><em>p.s.</em> If you are compiling, and you have swap, I would strongly recommend getting a USB3 drive (they sell pretty cheap these days), and hook that up with swap. Performance is definitely going to be up!</p>

<p><em>p.p.s.</em> by all means, do NOT use swap. it is slow. If possible, get some more memory instead of a USB3 drive meant to be used as swap. The read-speed ratios about 100:1 (okay, exaggerating. maybe around 50:1. Get the point. Physical memory, RAM, is faster, always (unless you have a <em>kewl</em> drive that does a 25 gbit/s read)).</p>

<p>Can't afford RAM (like me?), then you should perhaps tweak your "swappiness".

  <p>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,</p>

  <p>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,</p>

  <p>There is society, where none intrudes,</p>

  <p>By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:</p>

  <p>I love not Man the less, but Nature more [.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some very meaningful lines by <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/lord-byron">Lord Byron</a>.</p>

<p>This can be interpreted in a thousand different ways than what the poet could have imagined, but this still makes a lot of sense. Instead of trying to hide the hard truth, we are moving away from nature, and we know that. I found solace in a peaceful garden I went to, when I was little on a family trip to a hillstation; where I stopped for a while to notice the static silence <em>yet</em> the sparkle of life all around; where I forgot all my worries, and have nothing to care for. There was beauty in the stillness of it. And yet, I do not refer to dissolution, for the very essence of life is motion. </p>

<p>It seems that we are <em>now-a-days</em> bounded by things (which we don't need), just as Tyler Durden aptly puts it in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/">Fight Club</a>:</p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the amount of <em>stress</em> we deal with, the problems we face (which are often our <strong>own</strong> <em>creations</em>), I am reminded of the chains we are bound to these days, which leads me thinking to another few lines from <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173098">The Prisoner of Chillon</a>, again by Lord Byron:  </p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>Because I could have smiled to see
  The death that would have set me free.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thinking much more about it, it boils down to my career. I am yet again reminded of another quote from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/">Into the Wild</a> (<em>please do watch this movie some day</em>) where Christopher McCandless says:</p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>Mr. Franz, I think careers are a 20th century invention and I don't want one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also says:  </p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual pilgrimage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet again, he says:</p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And no, I do not plan to <em>escape</em> into the wild any time soon, but am amazed by the ways of society, and how humans have thought for a long time, that they can survive, by not depending on nature. I can't find lines that would better <em>explain</em> the pathetic state that this would lead to; where Dr. Ichiro Serizawa says in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0831387/">Godzilla</a>:</p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>The arrogance of men is thinking nature is in their control and not the other way around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might also want to really <em>really</em> listen to Paul Wood's speech at TED, on the topic: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjjlsW1MDmc">What's your prison?</a></p>

<p>Given that, I end this random post, with a few lines from <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173098">The Prisoner of Chillon</a>:</p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>A light broke in upon my brain,</p>

  <p>It was the carol of a bird;</p>

  <p>It ceased, and then it came again,</p>

  <p>The sweetest song ear ever heard,</p>

  <p>And mine was thankful till my eyes</p>

  <p>Ran over with the glad surprise,</p>

  <p>And they that moment could not see</p>

  <p>I was the mate of misery;</p>

  <p>But then by dull degrees came back</p>

  <p>My senses to their wonted track;</p>

  <p>I saw the dungeon walls and floor</p>

  <p>Close slowly round me as before,</p>

  <p>I saw the glimmer of the sun</p>

  <p>Creeping as it before had done,</p>

  <p>But through the crevice where it came</p>

  <p>That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,</p>

  <p>And tamer than upon the tree;</p>

  <p>A lovely bird, with azure wings,</p>

  <p>And song that said a thousand things,</p>

  <p>And seemed to say them all for me!</p>

I would say that would be the simplest and most reasonable cause for init.d to ever exist; but on phones, should it be that way. 'droid phones don't have alot of <em>functionality</em> to perform, nor do they have to worry about <em>services</em> and stuff, which is/ or should be handled by the frameworks, so, which leaves to the basic init.d which would run at every startup (<em>called</em> actually), to run a couple of commands which would set up the device for usage. I had written a fairly long post <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=48632724&amp;postcount=12">here</a>, on how init.d scripts work in 'droid (as a follow up to my explaination of how <em>memory increasing</em> scripts worked on 'droid <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=48606215&amp;postcount=6">here</a>); which all clearly explain that init.d scripts were simple in 'droid. And it needn't be any more complicated than that/ or could be, for the reason that handling a bunch of services, start/stop dawgmons, all with the busybox, or a proprietary <em>toolbox</em>; I don't even know if it all would be possible.</p>

<p>But then, there's unix. I'm assuming that the <em>stone age</em> init.d scripts for a unix based system, was as simple as the ones we have in 'droid devices today, given there wasn't much to systems those days. But as they grew increasingly complex, and as the concepts of services, background processes, daemons coming into picture, the necessity of increasing complexity can clearly be seen. From some of the <em>README</em> files found in the folders, they date back to <em>System V init</em> documentation, which makes me think: Were computers made that complex since the very beginning? I'm hoping the answer would be time, for from what I know, the System V wasn't the first of computers, or of unix based computers to that day.</p>

<p>Which brings me to another question of "Why are the init systems so complex?" The logical answer would be that "a lot of simple systems together make a complex system". Closely looking at it, I find even the creation of a simple init.d script slightly <em>annoying</em>, for the fact that they used to be simple at a 'droid level. Some of the documentation makes it seemingly mandatory to add some header text, which frankly speaking, I hate.</p>

<p>Having spoken so much on why I hate them, lemme also add a few points on why I love them. They can be configured to run at any user level. Want a program/stuff to be done when computer turns on, &lt;<em>xyz</em>> logs in/out, when system is shutdown, etc. The core concept behind, is that these are essentially services in an operating system, or so they have tended to be, which can be toggled from userspace using the  </p>

<pre><code>sudo service &lt;foo&gt; &lt;bar&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>commands, where <em>foo</em> is the service and <em>bar</em> are the "commands". You might toggle the service, check it's status, restart the service, etc, etc, given you set up the init.d script <strong>correctly</strong>; which is often not very often. Given that, init.d scripts come in handy for this very purpose, as I have a lot of programs that run as services, such as <a href="http://www.noip.com/">noip2</a> (which updates my no-ip's DNS to my current IP (yes, I do have dynamic IP :( )), <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">apache tomcat</a> (as usual, the webserver most people use), and OFC, <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a> (the blogging platform I write in, which you are reading). I think the most prominent reason for me to actually <em>love</em> them scripts are written above: "They are user-friendly." You don't need to bother about how they work, let alone write one (It's difficult. I tried.).</p>

<p>In the end, it is its simplicity (it's written in bash <em>mostly</em>), which upon multiple layers of recursion seems complex (but <em>not</em> complex enough), which is what put me in the boolean tristate condition; where I couldn't love or hate them.</p>]]></description><link>http://thewisenerd.github.io/2014/09/09/on-why-i-love/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">25f88956-4dd0-40f4-8fbc-0bdd0b78c886</guid><category><![CDATA[init.d]]></category><category><![CDATA[linux]]></category><category><![CDATA[scripts]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vineeth Raj]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 09:58:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Willst Du - Robin Schulz & Alligatoah]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div class="embed-youtube" id="mNNfZuIA1GQ"></div>

This wasn’t an issue in the first place, just a limitation. As I needed to <br>  
continuously update, and check my website, and I couldn’t use my <br>  
“<a href="http://thewisenerd.github.io/" target="_blank">thewisenerd.github.io</a>”
address, I was annoyed.</p>

<p>The <i>problem</i> was that when I used my xyz.github.io address, it got <br>  
redirected to my IP, and my router, instead of redirecting it to port 80 <br>  
to my PC, connected to LAN, forwarded it to its own port 80, thus causing this <i>small</i> glitch.</p>

<p>An easy fix for this, was (in linux, of course), was modifying the /etc/hosts file. <!-- more --> <br>  
The <strong>/etc/hosts</strong> file is used to reverse-lookup domain names first, followed by the <br>  
computer sending out a DNS query (if the name-to-IP lookup fails in the <br>  
<strong>/etc/hosts</strong> file). So, I simply added the following line to the end it, and was editing my site from my favorite browser, instead of  
accessing my blog from the Tor Browser.</p>

<pre><code>192.168.1.x thewisenerd.github.io  
</code></pre>

<p>The question arises: Why does the router forward requests from LAN to <br>  
itself while requests from other computers to my WordPress server? The <br>  
answer is pretty simple. There was a  </p>

<blockquote>  
  <p>Enable or restrict LAN-side
  management access to the DSL router</p>
</blockquote>

<p>option in my router config page. <br>  
It meant that computers connected to the LAN could access the router <br>  
settings to modify them. I could not get myself disabling it, as I do <br>  
meddle with the DSL settings quite often.</p>]]></description><link>http://thewisenerd.github.io/2014/08/27/public-ip-redirects-to-router-config-page/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c5c9b864-33f9-44c9-acd3-7a05291ca0ab</guid><category><![CDATA[random]]></category><category><![CDATA[blog]]></category><category><![CDATA[net]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Vineeth Raj]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2014 20:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
